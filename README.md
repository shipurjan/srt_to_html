# srt_to_html
Python program to convert all .srt subtitle files in current directory into .html pages (with customizable .css and .js) 

This program converts subtitle files into html pages where you can use dictonaries, easily copy paste, seek to a certain position, etc. With customizable .js and .css files, if you like that. Pretty useful for language learning when watching anime or movies in your target language.

You need to have Python interpreter installed https://www.python.org/downloads/
You can run a pre-built .exe file in a folder with subtitle files
Or, if you're scared you can analyze the code (.py file) and run it via console
